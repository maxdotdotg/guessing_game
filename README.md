# guessing_game
This is the guessing game project from [the Rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html). The code will be nearly identical to the book, but I'm taking notes as in-line comments.

# Usage
* to build: `cargo build --release`
* to run the binary: `./guessing_game`
* to run using cargo: `cargo run`
